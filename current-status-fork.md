# Current Status - LowDragRTS Fork

## Overview
This document describes the current state of our LowDragRTS fork, focusing on recent improvements to the voxel engine, unit visualization, and camera controls.

## Recent Changes

### Voxel Engine Improvements
- Implemented edge detection for better voxel visibility
- Created custom glowing grid using cuboids instead of GridHelper
- Adjusted terrain generation parameters for better visibility
- Enhanced voxel rendering with proper depth testing and transparency

### Unit Visualization
- Units now sit level on the base plane without base rectangles
- Implemented glowing cyan effect for units
- Added dynamic health box colors based on health status
- Fixed unit line materials to be unaffected by lighting
- Improved unit selection and hover effects

### Camera Controls
- Fixed WASD movement to follow camera orientation
- Added ground plane barrier to prevent camera from going below ground
- Adjusted camera rotation limits to allow looking down from above
- Improved orbit controls behavior
- Fixed A/D strafing direction

### Lighting and Visual Effects
- Implemented day/night cycle
- Added bloom effect for better glow visualization
- Adjusted scene lighting for better contrast
- Enhanced grid visibility with emissive materials
- Improved overall scene illumination

## Known Issues
1. Camera movement:
   - W/S movement still needs fine-tuning for ground plane relative movement
   - Some edge cases in camera rotation may need adjustment

2. Unit visualization:
   - Some direction vectors and arrowheads may still need adjustment
   - Unit selection highlighting could be improved

3. Performance:
   - Edge detection may impact performance on lower-end systems
   - Bloom effect intensity may need optimization

## Next Steps
1. Fine-tune camera controls and movement
2. Improve unit command visualization
3. Optimize performance of visual effects
4. Enhance unit selection and interaction feedback
5. Add more visual polish to the voxel engine
