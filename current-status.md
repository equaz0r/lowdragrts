# LowDrag RTS - Current Development Status

## Current State
The project is a voxel-based RTS game with the following implemented features:
- Basic voxel engine and terrain generation
- Unit creation and basic movement
- Combat system foundation
- Selection system (needs fixes)
- Basic UI framework
- Day/night cycle
- Command visualization system

## Current Issues
The following TypeScript compilation errors need to be resolved:

### Game Class Issues (src/index.ts)
- Uninitialized properties:
  - effectsManager
  - dayNightCycle
  - debugUI
  - unitManager
- Unterminated template literal in onUnitSelected method
- Type mismatch between ControlMode and string in setControlMode

### Unit Class Issues (src/engine/units/Unit.ts)
- Missing arguments in several method calls
- Property 'showCommand' missing in CommandVisualizer
- Material property access issues on Object3D
- Type safety issue with Unit | null in combat handling

### UI Issues (src/engine/ui/GameUI.ts)
- Type mismatches between HTMLStyleElement and string
- Incorrect Node type handling in DOM manipulation
- TextContent property access on string type

### UnitManager Issues (src/engine/units/UnitManager.ts)
- Incorrect argument count in constructor calls
- Type issues in arithmetic operations with selection coordinates

### Other Issues
- Projectile.ts: Uninitialized 'trail' and 'trailPositions' properties
- HelpDialog.ts: Uninitialized 'dialog' property

## Planned Features
1. Visual Improvements
   - Enhanced unit models with distinct shapes
   - Better command visualization
   - Improved selection feedback
   - Hover effects for units

2. UI Enhancements
   - Clearer mode indicators
   - Better visual feedback for actions
   - Improved selection box visibility
   - Unit type indicators

3. Gameplay Features
   - Resource gathering system
   - Building construction
   - Unit production
   - Tech tree implementation

## Next Steps
1. Fix TypeScript compilation errors:
   - Initialize all properties in constructors
   - Correct type mismatches
   - Fix method parameter counts
   - Resolve arithmetic operation type issues

2. Implement visual improvements:
   - Distinct unit models (robot, harvester, builder)
   - Command arrow improvements
   - Selection and hover effects

3. Enhance UI feedback:
   - Mode indicator visibility
   - Action feedback
   - Selection visualization
   - Unit state indicators

## Testing Priorities
1. Unit selection and movement
2. Combat system
3. Visual feedback for all actions
4. UI responsiveness and clarity
5. Performance with multiple units

## Notes
- The selection box persistence issue needs investigation
- Command visualization arrows need repositioning
- Unit models need redesign for better visual distinction
- Type safety needs improvement across the codebase

## Addendum (Latest Status)

### Fixed Issues
1. Resolved TypeScript compilation errors in Game class:
   - Fixed uninitialized properties using non-null assertions
   - Corrected ControlMode.UNIT to ControlMode.UNIT_CONTROL
   - Fixed updateSelectedUnitsInfo by using correct GameUI method
   - Fixed unterminated template literal in onUnitSelected

### Remaining Issues
1. Projectile.ts:
   - Property 'trail' needs initialization
   - Property 'trailPositions' needs initialization

2. GameUI.ts:
   - Type mismatch between HTMLStyleElement and string
   - Incorrect Node type handling in DOM manipulation
   - TextContent property access on string type

3. HelpDialog.ts:
   - Property 'dialog' needs initialization

4. Unit.ts:
   - Constructor argument mismatches
   - Missing showCommand property on CommandVisualizer
   - Material property access issues
   - Type safety issue with Unit | null in combat handling

5. UnitManager.ts:
   - Constructor argument count mismatch
   - Type issues in arithmetic operations with selection coordinates

### Next Steps
1. Fix remaining TypeScript errors in order:
   - Initialize Projectile properties
   - Correct GameUI DOM manipulation types
   - Initialize HelpDialog properties
   - Fix Unit class constructor and method signatures
   - Resolve UnitManager type safety issues

2. Continue with planned features:
   - Enhanced unit models with distinct shapes
   - Improved command visualization
   - Better selection and hover feedback
   - Clearer UI mode indicators
