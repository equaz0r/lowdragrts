# Project Status - March 19, 2025

## Current State

### Terrain Generation and Rendering
- Created new branch `terraingentesting` for terrain and engine improvements
- Simplified terrain shader to focus on core functionality
- Added UV coordinates to chunk geometry for wireframe effect
- Modified chunk generation and initialization process
- Removed complex effects (metallic, roughness, pulsing) to focus on basic visibility

### Known Issues
1. Terrain Visibility
   - Terrain not visible until world regeneration
   - Base color (dark blue-grey) being overpowered by edge effects
   - Wireframe effect not working as intended
   - Bright green color dominating the appearance

2. Chunk Generation
   - Chunks require regeneration to become visible
   - Mesh updates may not be properly synchronized
   - UV coordinate generation needs verification

### Recent Changes
1. Shader Modifications
   - Reduced edge strength from 1.0 to 0.5
   - Made wireframe lines thinner (0.1 width)
   - Reduced wireframe intensity (0.3)
   - Improved color blending logic
   - Increased minimum alpha to 0.9

2. World Manager Updates
   - Added explicit mesh positioning
   - Force mesh updates after creation
   - Clear existing chunks before regeneration
   - Added explicit mesh updates after terrain generation

## Next Steps
1. Investigate why terrain requires regeneration to be visible
2. Fix color balance between base color and edge effects
3. Verify UV coordinate generation and wireframe effect
4. Consider alternative rendering approaches if current issues persist
5. Add debug visualization for chunk boundaries and mesh generation
