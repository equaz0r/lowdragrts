# Terrain System Rebuild Progress - March 19, 2025

## Current Status

### Completed Components
1. Grid System
   - Implemented 32x32 grid with proper cell sizing
   - Added grid lines with color attributes
   - Added grid mesh with pulse effect
   - Fixed grid orientation and scaling

2. Lighting System
   - Implemented day/night cycle
   - Added visual sun representation
   - Added dynamic ambient light
   - Fixed sun movement speed (1 hour per day cycle)
   - Added color transitions for dawn/dusk/night

3. Terrain System (Partial)
   - Implemented noise generation with multiple octaves
   - Created shader-based terrain material
   - Added height-based coloring
   - Implemented seed-based regeneration

### Current Issues

1. Terrain Orientation
   - Terrain appears as a thin strip/wall instead of covering the grid plane
   - Height variations are not properly oriented in 3D space
   - Need to fix the relationship between terrain geometry and grid coordinates

2. Sun Movement
   - Sun movement speed has been adjusted but may need further tuning
   - Sun orientation relative to terrain needs to be verified

## Next Steps

1. Fix Terrain Generation
   - Review and correct terrain geometry orientation
   - Ensure terrain covers entire grid area (-32 to +32)
   - Verify height mapping in 3D space
   - Consider using a different geometry type (e.g., BufferGeometry with custom attributes)

2. Improve Terrain Detail
   - Adjust noise octaves for better terrain variation
   - Fine-tune height scaling
   - Improve normal calculation for better lighting

3. Integration
   - Verify all systems work together correctly
   - Test performance with current implementation
   - Consider optimizations if needed

## Technical Notes

### Current Implementation Details
- Grid Size: 32x32
- Cell Size: 100 units
- Terrain Height Scale: 200 units
- Noise Texture Size: 4096x4096
- Day Length: 3600 seconds (1 hour)

### Known Issues
1. Terrain geometry is not properly oriented in 3D space
2. Height variations are not correctly mapped to the grid plane
3. Need to verify normal calculations for proper lighting

### Questions to Address
1. Should we consider using a different geometry type for the terrain?
2. Is the current noise generation approach suitable for the desired terrain style?
3. How should we handle terrain chunking for better performance?

## Next Session Goals
1. Fix terrain orientation and coverage
2. Verify sun movement and lighting
3. Test terrain generation with different seeds
4. Document any new issues or improvements needed
